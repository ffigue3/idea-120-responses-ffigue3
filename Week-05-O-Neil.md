# Weapons of Math Destruction

  In Chapter 3 “Arms Race Going to College,” WMDs can be formulas, diets, tax codes, tuitions, fees, and certain college experiences that can accumulate or cause a person to be caught in a loop. For example, In the reading it says, “Most of these people no doubt cherished their own college experience—that’s part of what motivated them to climb the academic ladder. Yet here they were at the summit of their careers, dedicating enormous energy toward boosting performance in fifteen areas defined by a group of journalists at a second-tier newsmagazine. They were almost like students again, angling for good grades from a taskmaster. In fact, they were trapped by a rigid model, a WMD.” Another example is when the reading explains how the luxuries that certain colleges give their students to enjoy their college experience can cause taxes, tuition, and fees to rise to the point that it would take a really long time to pay.

  In Chapter 5 “Civilian Casualties Justice in the Age of Big Data,” WMDs can cause multiple problems in the justice system. For example, in the reading, it says, “While looking at WMDs, we’re often faced with a choice between fairness and efficacy… WMDs, by contrast, tend to favor efficiency. By their very nature, they feed on data that can be measured and counted… If you think of a WMD as a factory, unfairness is the black stuff belching out of the smoke stacks. It’s an emission, a toxic one.” WMDs can be the corruption that can cloud law and order.

  From what I could understand about WMDs, the ones that I have seen is over consumption of products that often go to waste. There are a lot of times that people buy so much stuff that some of it ends up in the trash. It causes problems for both the environment and people’s budgets. Since, over consumption can lead to wasting money and causing a lot of accumulation in landfills.
