# My thoughts on James Bridle’s claim

I can neither agree nor disagree with James Bridle’s claim and point of view that, “Something is wrong on the internet.” In my experience, there were times that I stumble on a video or piece of information that I wished that I could unseen and/or unread. There were multiple times that I stumble on videos <!-- that looked like there meant for children’s entertainment or adaptations of children’s fairy tales --> that contains a lot of racial, gender, and religious biases against certain people and labeling them as ugly, uneducated, unable to love, or even cruel evil-hearted beings. Looking back at those videos, there were even times that I noticed that there were biases against women and little girls with my features and similar heritage. So, a part of me agrees that there is, “Something is wrong on the internet.”

But the other part is aware and agrees that it really depends on people’s choices on what they wish to put online and weather or not they wish to continue searching for things in the internet. In my experience, I was able to learn a lot about different cultures, stories from different points in time, and other information that I have never learned in school. There are even times that the information I learned became useful for school one or two grades after learning it for the first time. So, despite all of the bad parts of the internet, there are still some good that comes from looking through it.
