# Project 2: Green Screen proposal

For the Green Screen project, I’ll <!--most likely--> start off with finding and using photos and/or videos taken by me and members of my family. Then, rearrange them to show either a kind of flow or cycle to present events or things within my environment that could unveil what makes me who I am. I’ll also add a few things that might come to mind, while doing the project.
