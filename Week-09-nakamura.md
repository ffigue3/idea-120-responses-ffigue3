From what I could understand about the quote, (“interactive media ask us to identify with someone else’s mental structure”) when it comes to media, we have to pay attention to even the smallest details. There are often clues with media that will show certain characteristics about the creator. For example, there are interactive films that lets people change the story of the film by giving them options to choose for the characters and see the outcomes of their choices. The choices they make can lead to either a happy ending or a sad ending to the story. How the effects of the choices come out shows a bit about the author’s thoughts on how the protagonists and antagonists would act if the choices cause the protagonists to act a certain way to the antagonists. To put in simple terms, there are certain times that the antagonists would act like a friend to the protagonists (even though they’re bitter enemies), because of the choices people made for the protagonists.

From what I notice about stories and films is that they usually have a connection with the author’s background, one way or the other. Sometimes the main scenery or the origins of the main character can sometimes tell what is the author’s culture and his/her origin.
