# Week 3 Assignment

There are many kinds of tools for art. Depending on the work, there are times that the tools could be used as part of the medium to complete the artwork. For example, a computer is used as a tool for digital artworks, but it can be part of the art as well by being used to observe or interact with the work. Another example could be using a digital camera. Most people use cameras as a tool to take photos for their artworks, while some people use a camera for a different medium.

While taking a look at the Rhizome Anthology website, there were a few examples on how computers and cameras were use as tools and part of an art medium at the same time. Digital works like A Cyberfeminist Manifesto For The 21st Century, My Boyfriend Came Back From The War, Blacklash, Form Art, Floodnet, etc. were created through a computer that was later apart of the medium, when the artworks were complete. <!--In other words, the computer was used as a tool to create the digital works. But when the works were done and became interactive, the computer itself became a part of the art.--> As for works like The Dollie Clone Series, digital cameras were hidden within the work. The hidden cameras took videos of events that happed in front of the artwork.<!--In other words, the digital cameras were being used as both tools for one medium while being a part of a different medium at the same time.-->
