I’m unsure if whether or not the internet would be useful and egalitarian without methods like targeted ads or shaping interactions to content with specific design. I think that it really depends on the people who use the internet and chose to look at the ads or designs or let them “be lost among the sea of online content.”

In the reading, O'Neil mentioned several times about how to use other people’s personal information to decide weather or not to send an ad or something to a specific person. In the video, When Chalabi was talking about statistics, she said: “… when it comes to numbers, especially now you should be skeptical. But you should also be able to tell which numbers are reliable and which ones aren’t.” To put in simple terms, it really depends on weather or not a person chooses to use certain information.
